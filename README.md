# Generative AI Roadmap

A practical roadmap to learn Generative AI from the basics to the advanced.

---

## Stage 1: Basic Language
- Python basics (syntax, loops, functions, OOP)
- Python libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib
- Basic data handling & visualization

---
## Stage 2: Machine Learning Basics
- Data preprocessing (cleaning, scaling, encoding)
- Supervised vs unsupervised learning
- Basic ML models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - KNN
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall)

---

## Stage 3: Deep Learning Fundamentals
- Neural networks basics
- Activation functions
- Backpropagation concept
- TensorFlow / PyTorch basics
- Building simple neural networks

---

## Stage 4: NLP Foundations
- Text preprocessing
- Tokenization & embeddings
- RNNs, LSTMs basics
- Transformers introduction

---

## Stage 5: Generative AI Core
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Prompt engineering
- Hugging Face ecosystem
- Using OpenAI / LLM APIs

---

## Stage 6: Advanced GenAI
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Vector databases
- Fine-tuning models
- AI agents & workflows

---

## Stage 7: Real-world Projects
- Chatbot application
- Document Q&A system
- AI assistant project
- Portfolio-ready projects
